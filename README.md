# Vue.js Dashboard

Hello! My name's Pawe≈Ç Mucha. This is an example dashboard created using _Vue.js_, _Nuxt.js_ and _Vuetify.js_. You can check the compiled version out on [my website](https://pawelmucha.com/vue-dashboard/). It was created so you can see and assess my code quality.

You can contact me by e-mail [pawel@mucha.com](pawel@mucha.com) or take a look at my [Upwork profile](https://pawelmucha.com/upwork).

**In case you'd like to pull it and build:**

```bash
# The procedure is standard:
yarn install
yarn dev
```
